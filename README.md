# LLM-Course-Design

This repository documents an **experimental course framework for Large Language Models (LLMs)**, 
developed as a prototype of AI-driven education innovation.  

The project is part of my long-term initiative to design and build an **AI-native university**, 
where frontier AI research and scalable pedagogy converge.  

ðŸ“Œ The repository is not a collection of course notes, but a **curriculum experiment**:  
- Translating cutting-edge research (finetuning, alignment, inference, agents) into structured modules  
- Integrating code, theory, and visualization for reproducible learning  
- Exploring how **next-generation AI education** can be engineered as a system
